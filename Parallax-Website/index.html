        <h2>What is a JRPG?</h2>
            <p> JRPG (plural JRPGs) (video games) Initialism of Japanese role-playing game, a traditional genre of role-playing video game generally understood as involving a turn-based combat system, linear gameplay, a pre-determined story and player characters, and an emphasis on narrative and storytelling.<br>
                Early Japanese RPGs were also influenced by visual novel adventure games, which were developed by companies such as Enix, Square, Nihon Falcom and Koei before they moved onto developing RPGs.<br> 
                In the 1980s, Japanese developers produced a diverse array of creative, experimental computer RPGs, prior to mainstream titles such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy eventually cementing genre tropes by the 1990s.

        <h2>Types of JRPGs</h2>
        <p>
            As of all JRPGS, all of them originate from Japan and use themes surround Japanese artstyle or themes and ideas that they more gravitate towards to.<br>
            JRPGs are all mostly known for being turn-based (Allies and enemys take turns taking actions each battle) and more slow-paced than other Western games, however, that is just 
            the way these games are meant to be played.<br>
            Alongside turn-based combat, many JRPGs include an element of exploration, searching the overworld for treasures, secrets and hidden dungeons, puzzles, and an immersive storyline.<br>
            Most JRPGs really bank on creating a immersive fantasy world for the player to really dig into, finding lore of different types of people and cities, why things are the way they are in the world and the narrative behind the main cast of characters.<br>
            More older JRPGs such as Dragon Quest, Breathe of Fire, Fire Emblem and etc... have really cemented and continued to engage in using turn-based combat, letting players plan their next actions more strategically. <br>
            However, as time goes on, a lot more companies that produce JRPGS are adventuring into more Open-World Exploration games with the turn-based elements integrated in like Pokemon or to 
            just switch fully into an action RPG with JRPG elements.  Players these days seem to enjoy more fast-paced action when it comes to games and companies are merely reacting to the market. <br>
            That is not to say people do not enjoy the more traditional JRPG, games are evolving slowly overtime so players can enjoy more and more aspects within each entry.

        <h2>JRPGS vs Western RPGs</h2>
        <p>
            Broadly speaking, JRPGs have become known more for having pre-defined characters with set traits and personalities, whereas Western RPGs tend toward customizable characters,<br>
             where the player determines the character’s mechanical function and moral alignment. There are exceptions to both, of course.<br>
              The original Final Fantasy allowed the player to create their entire party, offering no suggested names and no distinct character traits among them.<br>
               Some modern Western RPGs, like The Witcher series, have a set protagonist with a very well-defined personality. In general, it is more likely that a Western RPG will focus on customization,<br>
                and JRPGs will offer pre-set, but more distinctive, characters. Linearity is another common distinction between the two main branches of RPGs,<br>
                 since well before the modern trend of open-world games Western RPGs tended to focus more on exploration and experimentation, whereas JRPGs typically had a more distinctly defined narrative path, with rarer detours to find optional side-content and secrets. <br>
                  This divergence in priority leads to strengths for both styles. Western RPGs might offer players a more personalized experience, as different character builds and choices in a game like the original Fallout or Baldur’s Gate might lead to distinctly different personal anecdotes. <br>
                  JRPGs tend to focus on strong, epic narratives that would be shared experiences for all players, as every Dragon Quest 5 player experiences the same generation-spanning tale of good against evil despite the differences in monsters they may recruit along the way.
